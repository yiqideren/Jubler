<section><title>How to translate to my own language</title>
    <para>The instructions here are for Linux (or similar POSIX) environment. First of all you will need to download the source code of Jubler (preferably from the SVN). Then go to recources/i18n folder and issue the following command (without quotes) "maketemplate". This will produce a file named "jubler.pot" into this directory. Rename this file into your locale 2-letter name (e.g. english should have been en.po) with the .po extension instead of .pot. Open this ??.po file with either a localization editor (like kbabel or poedit) or even with a text editor.</para>
    <para>When you have finished you can send this file to me in order to include it into the distribution. You can of course contact me earlier if you have any other questions.</para>
    <para>In order to check it yourself, you need to recompile java. You will need at least JDK 1.5 and ant to compile it.</para>

<section id="mplayer.winosx"><title>Installing MPlayer under Windows or Mac OSX</title>
    <para>In order to properly use MPlayer, you have to install somewhere the MPlayer files from <ulink url="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html">MPlayer website</ulink>. Under Windows make sure that you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> download the GUI version, since mplayer uses it's own GUI. After downloading and expanding open Jubler, create a new document, go to "Tools" - "Test video" - "Player options". Click on "Options" - "Browse" and select where MPlayer application is. </para>
</section>

<section><title>Installing MPlayer under Linux or POSIX environment</title>
    <para>You have again to download MPlayer from <ulink url="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html">MPlayer website</ulink>. Then, it is necessary to put it somewhere in your $PATH. After that, Jubler should be able to find it automatically. If not, you can follow the information mentioned under <ulink url="#mplayer.winosx">Installing MPlayer under Windows or Mac OSX</ulink>.</para>

<section><title>How can I enter translation mode?</title>
    <para>There is no such thing as "translation mode". Instead there is a parent/child approach which is more flexible, since it is a tree-like relationship instead of one-to-one. Every file might have a "parent" file; of course one parent might have more than one children. When a subtitle is selected on the child file, the subtitle with the closest time on the parent file is selected too. This is always the case either when a user selects a subtitle with the mouse, or if a subtitle is automatically selected (e.g. while playing or previewing).</para>
    <para>This selection propagates to the "grandparent" (i.e. the parent of the parent) and so on, up to the file which has no parents at all. Of course you could display all the windows simultaneously on screen and see how the selected subtitle propagates at their parent. When a subtitle is selected on the parent file, the selected subtitle on the children is not altered.</para>
    <para>On order to (un)set the parent of a file, go to "Tools" - "Reparent" and (de)select the parent file. If you want to start a translation from scratch, i.e. having a new file with the correct time-slots but without any text, go to "File" - "New" - "Child" and a new file will open, with it's parent to the current one. It would be wise to detach the subtitle edit box from the child, hide the subtitle edit box from the parent and enlarge the visible subtitle box to take the whole space underneath the subtitle windows.</para>
</section>

<section><title>How can I synchronize subtitles with two given timepoints</title>
    <para>This can be performed using the Video Console. Let the movie play and then when you hear a subtitle, press the "T" button. The movie then pauses. Go to the main window and select the subtitle you have just heard. The first synchronization button (on the left of the "T" button) lights up. Then go to the end of the movie withough closing the Video Console. Again when you hear a subtitle, press the "T" button. The playback pauses again. Select the subtitle from the main window. Then the recode window will pop up. Use the custom parameters and press OK.</para>
    <para>If the recode window did not show up, it means that the time points chosen are not valid and it is impossible to recode. You have to select another time position. The last selected position is deselected then.</para>
    <para>If the subtitle time difference is the same on both time positions, then shift time is performed instead of recoding.</para>
    <para>There is also another way of selecting the time positions. Instead of selecting the subtitle text from the main window, you can shift the subtitled using the bar on the lower left of the Console. Then when you thing that the subtitles are synchonized, press either synchonization buttons.</para>
</section>

<section id="synchronize"><title>How can I synchronize subtitles from an external file?</title>
    <para>In order to synchronize the subtitles of one file with the subtitles of another, you have to open both files in Jubler. Then go to the file you want to  work on and select tool "Synchronize". Select which subtitles you want to synchronize (possibly all of them), the "model" subtitles (from the other file), if there is any offset and if you want to synchronize time-stamps or text. After clicking OK the synchronization will be performed. Keep in mind that the offset is based on index of the subtitle and not on time.</para>
</section>

<section><title>How can I shift subtitles text, while keeping the time-stamp slots constant?</title>
    <para>There are times where you want to keep the various time-stamps of subtitles steady and shift the subtitle texts - relative to their time-stamp. Here comes <ulink url="#synchronize">synchronize</ulink> to the rescue again. The only difference from the previous approach is that you select the "-current-" subtitle file and you enter the offset. You can either shift time-stamps or text.</para>
</section>

<section><title>How can I change the video file?</title>
    <para>The position of this menu entry has changed in recent versions of Jubler. This option is under "File"->"Change media file".</para>
</section>

<section><title>How is transparency produced?</title>
    <para>In subtitle preview, although outline & shadow color is per character, their transparency is calculated for the whole subtitle entry.</para>
</section>

<section><title>What is Zemberek and how can I use it?</title>
    <para>Zemberek is a spell checking library for the Turkish language. You have to download the binary distribution of zemberek <ulink url="https://zemberek.dev.java.net/">from its website</ulink> first. Version 0.6.4 was tested with this version of Jubler. Unzip the file, and copy zemberek-0.6.4.jar under JUBLER_HOME/lib/zemberek.jar. Then Jubler should be able to open this library. 
    </para>

<section><title>Problems while loading a subtitle file</title>
    <para>Since the subtitle loader is still under development, it is possible that when loading a valid supported subtitle file, a message will pop up informing that it is unable to load this file. In such a case you can <ulink url="http://www.jubler.org">contact me or write in the forum</ulink> and send me the problematic subtitle file.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Problems while creating preview</title>
    <para>Sometimes when opening preview for a valid video file, a message informing that preview is not available may pop up. This sometimes happens when there is a problem with the initialization of the ffdecode library from your Java environment. Usually closing the Preview window and open it again helps. When this doesn't help, a restart of Jubler solves this situation. I am really interested on these kind of problems, so when you can reproduce this error, please give me a note.</para>
</section>

<section><title>I found a problem!</title>
    <para>I am always happy to listen to problems of Jubler, especially those not mentioned here. The best way to inform me is through the <ulink url="http://www.jubler.org">Jubler site</ulink>. Sometimes the site has problems, reload the page and it will show up. The preferred way is through the forum, but if the forum is down (or I haven't answer in 2-3 days) email me directly.</para>
