General
-------

Jubler is a tool to edit text-based subtitles. It can be used an an
authoring software for new subtitles or as a tool to convert,
transform, correct and refine existing subtitles.

It is open source under a liberal (GNU) public licence. It is written
in Java 5.0(a.k.a. Java 1.5.0 ) in order to be really multi-platform.
It has been tested under Linux, Windows XP and Mac OS. 


Features
--------

General features

  SubViewer (1 and 2) and MicroDVD file formats, although it is easy
  to extend it to support other file types.

  (like UTF-8). The user is able to select a list of preferred
  encodings in order to load the localized subtitle files.

  time

  time when playing the video

version of MPlayer.


How to run
----------

If you have downloaded the binary distribution, the installer should have
created an link to your "Start" menu and (possibly) on your desktop. In any
other case go to the Jubler installation directory and issue the following
command:
  java -jar Jubler.jar
On some systems a double click is enough to start the application.



Specific issues
---------------

a) Problems while loading a subtitle file

Since the support for SSA & ASS format is still under development (and also
the others), it is possible that when loading a valid supported subtitle
file, a message will pop up informing that it is unable to load this file.
In such a case you can contact me and send me the problematic subtitle file.


b) Distance of the lowest part of the screen is finally computed by taking
into account the shadow and outline values.

c) Although outline & shadow color is per character, their transparency is 
calculated for the whole subtitle entry.
